                <h1>Starting</h1>
                <p>When I first started this challenge I started it on college computer making basic django site with no design, nothing.
                    I chose to start working on a website design for the challenge for fun and to make challenge more difficult. First of I began on
                    the index page which contains main redirects to creation page and was where I first started to design the navigation bar.
                    The navigation bar as of right now has no functionality but can redirect user back to main web page once this section is done I intend on creating
                    view database page.
                </p>

                <h1>Creating The Edit Database Page</h1>
                <p>Created the edit database web page has full error handling for data what has been already inserted also informed of some issues I had with my navigation bar
                    my navigation bar was stretched to bottom of the screen I couldn't exactly make change to this problem but did make work around to this issue so everything works
                    accordingly using z-index this also brought me to issue of positions being static I fixed this and changed them to relative. I also made all my input boxes have
                    nice hover effect this idea was inspired by wix's design of input textboxs.

                <h1>Creating The View Database Page</h1>
                <p>Created the view database page this was more painful as the render method uses a file and if I customized the file to change data inside it would
                    break everything as their would be no format value it would be replaced it would also contain old data I didn't want this issue so I had to make two
                    new files to contain styling to open up from it's current directory and the html code to open up then format them I use formatting through method of {0}
                    or {1} using python we can format these to have new values in. The table configuring was also a pain due to how I wanted to style it but in end I got it completed.

                <h1>Problem Solving The Creation Page</h1>
                <p>When adding numerous elements I discovered this issue at the start of this page I noticed if scroll bar was there the footer would be able to be scrolled past
                    this was an easy fix I solved this by changing the position to fixed this solved my problem made it so I didn't have to seperate data onto numerous pages for the user.

                <h1>Making The Database</h1>
                <p>As the database provided was localhosted by the college meaning could not be accessed on devices outside of college I had to find way to work on it outside of college
                    as I had ideas for creating website about this challenge which is what you see now to solve this problem I downloaded, SQL Server 2019 hosted my own made custom table
                    under the name of BasicAuthentication like I did on college I replicated my table design. After setting this all up I then connected it up to python using the driver
                    {ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server} Then I started working on website.
