# Django-Frontend-ManagerMnaager
This was challenge I was told to do I went above and beyond and decided to code up a whole site for everything there's lots of flaws in the code and vulnerabilities on the site but this was never public and was for a challenge.

Some vulnerabilities include

- SQL Injection

- and some minor django vulns

I'm not huge web designer so this was my first time giving main go at it but was definetly learning experience in web development.
