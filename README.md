# Django-Frontend-Database-Manager
This was challenge I was told to do I went above and beyond and decided to code up a whole site for everything there's lots of flaws in the code and vulnerabilities on the site but this was never public and was for a challenge.

Some vulnerabilities include

- SQL Injection

- and some minor django vulns

I'm not huge web designer so this was my first time giving main go at it but was definetly learning experience in web development.

The import section i didn't finish keep in mind I coded this in about a days time within 4 hours with minimal experience in actual web development here's a summary of the files

Main Directory

- db this is structure part created by django this doesn't contain my main views
- main this contains the python code for web pages on the backend also contains the database configs etc in the views.py
- templates this is where the html code for the site is stored
- webcontent this is where none hosted html code is stored the hosted and not hosted are seperated due to importing css in hosting can cause problems with none hosted css code
- databaseCode.txt this contains the table code to create the table I used in my database
- db.sqlite3 legit ignore I didn't use this
- manage.py this is for running the server and adding apps etc
- requirements.txt this is pip requirements to run this code
- styling.css this is used for specific part of code

Command: python manage.py runserver

This code is extremely unorganised and was made in roughly 4 hours with not much previous experience please take this into account.
